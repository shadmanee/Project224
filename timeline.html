                <p>
                  Following the Stone and the Copper ages, Bengal was
                  settled by Austroasiatics, Tibeto-Burmans, Dravidians and Indo-
                  Aryans in consecutive waves of migration. Archaeological
                  evidence confirms that by the second millennium BCE, the Bengal
                  delta was inhabited by rice-cultivating communities.
                  Rivers such as the Ganges and Brahmaputra were used for transport
                  while maritime trade flourished in the Bay of Bengal.

                  The Iron Age saw the development of coinage, metal weapons,
                  agriculture and irrigation. Large urban settlements formed in
                  the middle of the first millennium BCE, when the Northern Black
                  Polished Ware culture dominated the northern part of Indian subcontinent.

                  One of the largest empires in the subcontinent history,
                  the Mauryan empire was established by Chandragupta Maurya.
                  Under Mauryan rule, a single efficient system of finance,
                  administration and security was created. The reign of Ashoka
                  ushered an era of social harmony, religious transformation

                  The Gupta empire is regarded as a golden age in the
                  subcontinental history. It was marked by extensive
                  scientific and cultural advancements that crystallized
                  the elements of what is generally known as the Hindu culture.
                  Bengal was an important province under the Gupta empire. The
                  discovery of Gupta coins across Bengal point to a monetized
                  economy.

                  first ruler of the empire, coming to power through an election by chieftains
                  in Gauda. The Pala dynasty lasted for four centuries and ushered in a period
                  of stability and prosperity in Bengal. The empire reached its peak under Emperor
                  Dharmapala and Devapala. The death of Devapala ended the period of ascendancy of
                  the Pala dynasty and several independent dynasties and kingdoms

                  The Islamic conquest of Bengal began with the capture
                  of Gauda from the Sena dynasty in 1204. Led to victory
                  by Bakhtiar Khilji, the Delhi Sultanate maintained a
                  strong vigil on Bengal. Gradually, eastern Bengal was
                  absorbed into Muslim rule, through the Conquest of Sylhet.
                  Sufis played an important role in the absorption fo Bengal.
                  During the Tughluq dynasty, the taka was introduced as the
                  imperial currency.

                  A confederation of twelve zamindar families resisted the expansion of the Mughal Empire during the
                  16th and 17th centuries. The zamindars included Muslims and Hindus. They were led by the Muslim Rajput
                  chief Isa Khan.

                  The Mughal absorption of Bengal began with the Battle of Ghaghra in 1529, in which the Mughal army was
                  led by the first Mughal emperor Babur.

                  Subedars were the Mughal viceroys in Bengal. The Bengal Subah was part of a larger prosperous empire
                  and shaped by imperial policies of pluralistic government. The Mughals built the provincial capital in
                  Dhaka in 1610 with fortifications, gardens, tombs, palaces and mosques. Dhaka was also named in honour
                  of Emperor Jahangir as Jahangirnagar.

                  By the 18th century, Mughal Bengal became a quasi-independent country under the nominal rule of the
                  emperor in Delhi. The subedar was elevated to the status of a hereditary Nawab Nazim. The Nawabs
                  maintained de facto control of Bengal while minting coins in the name of the emperor in Delhi.

                  independent Nawab of Bengal due to his defeat to British forces at the Battle of Plassey in 1757.
