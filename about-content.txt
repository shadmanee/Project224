With a population of almost 162.7 million, Bangladesh is a small country 
located in the delta of the Padma (the Ganges/ Ganga) and Jamuna (Brahm-
aputra) rivers in the northeastern part of South Asia. It is bordered by
the Indian states of West Bengal to the west and north, Assam to the no-
rth, Meghalaya to the north and northeast, and Tripura and Mizoram to t-
he east. To the southeast, it shares a boundary with Myanmar (Burma). The 
southern part of Bangladesh opens into the Bay of Bengal. In its southern
region, Bangladesh is fringed by the Sunderbans, a huge expanse of marshy 
deltaic forest.

Modern day Bangladesh was part of the Mughal Empire until the arrival of 
the British East India Company. When the British left in 1947, it became 
the eastern wing of Pakistan, or, East Pakistan. Bangladesh became an in-
dependent country in 1971 after nine months of liberation war under the
leadership of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
In the last decade, Bangladesh has experienced huge economic growth due 
to sound macroeconomic management and massive investment in human resou-
rces and infrastructures. The economy of the country is growing close to
8% in the last two fiscal years.
